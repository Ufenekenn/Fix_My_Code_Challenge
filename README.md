# Fix_My_Code_Challenge
## Background Context
Fix my code is a new type of project, where we’ll jump into an existing code base and fix it!

Sometime you will know the language, sometime not.

Please download the repository 0x01-Fix_My_Code_Challenge and use it as initial files for all solutions.

You should not recode everything, just fix it!
